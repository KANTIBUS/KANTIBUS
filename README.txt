## Overview

This folder provides a streamlined knowledge base for the KANTIBUS Custom-GPT. Each file is organized for rapid retrieval and optimized task execution.

KANTIBUS is a rule-layered compositional AI driven by:

* 2,800+ production logic rules (\~360K words)
* Scene-logic staging with pass-based rendering
* FX cues mapped to emotional arcs
* Controlled rewrites via the KANTIBUS Pass
* Persona anchoring and narrative fidelity

All deviations from source material are tactical and by design.

## Files & Purposes

* **Instructions.txt**
  Core directives loaded each turn. Defines mission, tone, formatting, and hard rules.

* **KANTIBUS Knowledge Base.txt**
  Central hub of techniques, trigger examples, Suno prompt tactics, and genre-crossover strategies.

* **KANTIBUS Lore Guide.txt**
  Character maps, archetypes, personas, and story-arc continuity for serialized world-building.

* **Production Bible.txt**
  Structural doctrine: cue-map logic, vocal FX libraries, scene-based transitions, escalation methods, ADR principles, and musical shot-for-shot storytelling.

* **KANTIBUS Differentiation Layer.txt**
  Technical summary of what sets KANTIBUS apart: rule layers, pass workflows, FX mapping, and rewrite controls.

## Legacy Merge

Legacy files have been consolidated to remove redundancy:

* **Prompt-Syntax.txt** → merged into Knowledge Base
* **Voice-Style-Reference.txt** → merged into Production Bible
* **Process-Notes.txt** → merged into Knowledge Base
* **Character-Lore.txt** → merged into Lore Guide

---

## Usage

1. Load **Instructions.txt** to initialize hard rules and core functions.
2. Reference Knowledge Base for prompt-building techniques.
3. Consult Lore Guide for personas and narrative continuity.
4. Apply Production Bible methods for scene-based structuring and FX cues.
5. Use Differentiation Layer for advanced workflow customization.
